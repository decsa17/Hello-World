# Hello-World
I really don't know what I am doing ??/* <---- that was 7mos ago now i kinda know what im doing :) */


So, I'm a bartender by profession recently getting a huge interest in web development specifically front end
and so far i have learned basic of html and css now im trying to master css and learn javascript and alsot jQuery and bootstrap
I really think  I have a passion for this and wished I took computer science when i was younger I couldve learned a lot of stuff by now but its not over I still have all the time in the world!
